# Simple Web System
 Simple Web System, created with HTML, PHP and SQL to recolect and store data obtained via forms in a database.

 This web system was created as the final project for college, researching as to why most if not all web systems are private, as well as studying its
 development and functionality as a single student/dev.

Be aware, all the code is written IN SPANISH, since I'm a Chilean student, but that may change eventually.

The database used in the system is localhost for various reasons, hence why it doesn't have a web deployment, though that can be changed easily in the code.
